facts = [{'title':"Hand sanitizers can be used often","bio":"An alcohol-based sanitizer does not create antibiotic resistance. Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, pathogens (harmful germs) do not seem to develop resistance to alcohol-based sanitizers."},
{'title':"Alcohol-based sanitizers are safe for everyone to use","bio":"Alcohols in the sanitizers have not been shown to create any relevant health issues. Little alcohol is absorbed into the skin, and most products contain an emollient to reduce skin dryness. Allergic contact dermatitis and bleaching of hand hair due to alcohol are very rare adverse effects. Accidental swallowing and intoxication have been described in rare cases."},
{'title':"Alcohol-based sanitizers can be used in religions where alcohol is prohibited","bio":"Any manufactured substance developed to alleviate illness or contribute to better health is permitted by the Qur'an, including alcohol used as a medical agent. "},

{'title':"It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves","bio":"Wearing gloves risks transferring germs from one surface to another and contaminating your hands when removing them. Wearing gloves does not replace cleaning hands. Health workers wear gloves only for specific tasks."},
{'title':"Touching a communal bottle of alcohol-based sanitizer will not infect you","bio":"Once you've sanitized your hands, you have disinfected them from any germs that may have been on the bottle. If everyone uses sanitizer in a public place such as a supermarket entrance, the risk of germs on communal items will be lower and will help keep everyone safe."},
{'title':"An alcohol-based handrub is listed as a WHO essential medicine","bio":"Clean hands protect patients, health workers, other caregivers and everyone from infection. Cleaning your hands is one of the key measures to prevent disease."},
{'title':"Clinical trials confirm that hydroxychloroquine does not prevent illness or death from COVID-19.","bio":"Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a common treatment for malaria and certain autoimmune diseases, has been studied as a preventative treatment for COVID-19. Evidence from these studies shows that hydroxychloroquine has little to no impact on illness, hospitalization, or death. "},
{'title':"Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19","bio":"Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19."},
{'title':"Is dexamethasone a treatment for all COVID-19 patients?","bio":"Dexamethasone should be reserved for patients who need it most. It should not be stockpiled.

This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste  that could be carried on the soles of shoes."},
{'title':"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria","bio":"The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses.Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance."},
{'title':"The prolonged use of medical masks* when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency","bio":"The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally.
