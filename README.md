## Inspiration
My Inspiration was that I wanted to create a place where you can get all the infos about Covid at One Place and why that one place can't be your homepage. So I decided to create a **HomePage** where one can easily search and read about every important things related to Covid.

## What it does
It's a Homepage for Covid's Frontline Workers. It helps you get the **latest info about covid** from **mythbusters to statistical data** about every countries. You can also **read news** related to Covid-19. Not only this it also finds the **latest video** from the WHO's YouTube Channel and returns only those videos which are related to Covid-19 Virus. The Site Keeps **updating every second** so the user can get the latest data first about anything related to Covid. You can also make it **homepage** to be latest with all the infos regarding Covid19. I added a search engine to directly search from Google and YouTube right away from the HomePage.
## How we built it
I built this site using Flask module in Python. **Flask** is really great tool to work efficiently with Python and HTML at the same time. I gathered all the trusted and official sources then I **fetched the data** from these source. Then I **filter and sort all the data** and **removed** everything which was out of context. I make a collection of such datas and add them to my website with the help of jinja and html. Then I designed my website. I focused a lot on designing part. I have also created a **reading progress bar** through which you can have a track of how much news and data you have read. 

## Challenges we ran into
It took me hours just to find the right and trusted sources from all over the web from where I can get the official and **Genuine data.**
Secondly Not All sources that I found provide an API or get-request so I have to again look for hours for api's. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am really proud that I am the first person ever to came up with such Idea that can help so much people get right information at the right time. It's gonna help thousands of people. It will definitely be a worthy tool for covid workers as the first thing they will notice as soon as they open their browser will be the top headlines and latest videos from official sources like WHO. 
## What we learned

## What's next for CovidTimes 
I thought of adding a feature which will let you **select the sources** from where you want news and you will also be able to show only the data of the country in which you live, so it will be more better for worker to concentrate on their country's status.
